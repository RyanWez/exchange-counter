**Exchange Counter** is a specialized application designed specifically for **Money Changers** and **Exchange Counter Operators**.

Unlike generic exchange rate viewers, this app is built to solve the daily operational pain points of money changers. It eliminates the need for manual calculator work when dealing with customers.

## 🎯 Core Purpose

**"No more manual calculations for every customer."**

When a customer arrives at your counter to exchange money (e.g., changing 100,000 MMK to THB), you shouldn't have to reach for a calculator every time.

- **Instant Calculation**: Enter the amount the customer hands you, and instantly see exactly how much you need to pay out.
- **Daily Rate Management**: Easily set your buying and selling rates for the day.
- **Transaction Speed**: Reduce waiting time for customers and minimize human error in calculations.

- **🚀 Ultra Fast Performance**: Powered by **Vite 7** for instant load times.
- **📱 PWA Ready**: Works offline! Install it on your phone, tablet, or desktop.
